    "    1] The TfidfVectorizer is used to convert the raw documents into a matrix of TF-IDF features. fit_transform both fits the model to the data and transforms the data into its TF-IDF representation.\n",
    "    2]We isolate the TF-IDF vector for the 3rd document (\"the mouse ran away from the house\") and then compute the cosine similarity between this vector and all other documents using the linear_kernel function.Here, tfidf_matrix[2:3] extracts the TF-IDF vector for the 3rd document from the TF-IDF matrix. In Python, indexing starts from 0, so 2:3 refers to the third document. The resulting query_doc is a sparse matrix containing the TF-IDF representation of the 3rd document.\n",
    "    The linear_kernel function from scikit-learn computes the linear kernel (dot product) between the TF-IDF vector of the 3rd document (query_doc) and the TF-IDF matrix of all documents (tfidf_matrix). This operation results in a one-dimensional array of cosine similarity scores between the 3rd document and each of the other documents.\n",
    "    3]cosine_similarities.argsort() returns the indices that would sort the cosine_similarities array in ascending order.\n",
    "[-2:-1] extracts the second-to-last element in the sorted indices. This corresponds to the index of the most similar document in the original docs list.\n",
